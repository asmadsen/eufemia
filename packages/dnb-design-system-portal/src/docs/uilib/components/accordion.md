# Accordion

**Under development**

## Single Accordion

<AccordionDefaultExample />

## Accordion with a single container

A single container is used only for wider screens (desktop).

<AccordionContainerExample />

## Grouped Accordion

**NB:** Please to avoid using a group, because it initiate an unexpected result, something the user not would expect to happen. It is an automated out of context UI execution.

<AccordionGroupExample />
